 * objects overloading the + operator can be summed.
 *
 * @note We are using the Standard Template Library (STL) stack in this
 * problem. Its pop function works a bit differently from the stack we
 * built. Try searching for "stl stack" to learn how to use it.

/**
 * Checks whether the given string (stored in a queue) has balanced brackets.
 * A string will consist of square bracket characters, [, ], and other
 * characters. This function will return true if and only if the square bracket
 * characters in the given string are balanced. For this to be true, all
 * brackets must be matched up correctly, with no extra, hanging, or unmatched
 * brackets. For example, the string "[hello][]" is balanced, "[[][[]a]]" is
 * balanced, "[]]" is unbalanced, "][" is unbalanced, and "))))[cs225]" is
 * balanced.
 *
 * For this function, you may only create a single local variable of type
 * `stack<char>`! No other stack or queue local objects may be declared. Note
 * that you may still declare and use other local variables of primitive types.
 *
 * @param input The queue representation of a string to check for balanced brackets in
