## mp_traversals

Developed object-oriented programming skills through completing a programming assignment that involved implementing classes to traverse and manipulate images. Learned to use CMake and built custom makefiles. Implemented various image traversal techniques, including Depth First Search and Breadth First Search, and created an iterator to traverse through the images. Also gained experience in flood filling an image using ColorPicker and ImageTraversal classes. Developed a custom ColorPicker and used it to create a unique image.

## mp_stickers

It involving the implementation of the Image and StickerSheet classes. Successfully utilized CMake and Catch2 to build and test code, while working with the HSL color space to transform hue, saturation, and luminance values of images. Developed skills in object-oriented programming, inheritance, and pointer arrays. Demonstrated ability to work with industry-standard tools and methodologies to create custom makefiles, test code, and create an image with stickers using the StickerSheet class.

## mp_mosaics

Implemented a KD-Tree data structure for generating photomosaics in C++, as part of a machine project. The KD-Tree was used to efficiently search for the closest matching tile image to a given region of an original image based on average color. The project involved implementing two critical components: the KD-Tree class and the KDTileMapper class. The KD-Tree class was a templated class that could work with any positive, non-zero number of dimensions, and involved implementing several member functions such as smallerDimVal and shouldReplace. The KDTileMapper class was responsible for mapping TileImages to a MosaicCanvas based on their average color, and used the KD-Tree for finding the nearest neighbor. The project also included writing additional test cases to thoroughly test the code.

## mp_mazes

Implemented a disjoint sets data structure and a random maze generator and solver in C++. The project was broken down into two parts. In part one, the DisjointSets data structure was implemented, and each DisjointSets object represented a family of disjoint sets, where each element had an integer index. In part two, the SquareMaze random maze generator and solver was implemented. The SquareMaze class represented a randomly-generated square maze and its solution. The setWall and canTravel functions were triple checked to ensure that they functioned exactly according to their descriptions, as errors in these functions would not be caught by making your own mazes but could cost a majority of the points during grading. The BFS traversal was used to solve the maze, and the final maze solution was represented on a PNG image.

## mp_schedule

Implemented a file parser and data cleaner using CMake and designed and implemented a heuristic solution to graph coloring to schedule exams. Created a functional graph representation of student and course data and produced a valid scheduling using a greedy coloring heuristic algorithm. Developed skills in data parsing and cleaning, graph theory, and algorithm design and implementation. Used Git for version control and collaborated with team members to ensure successful completion of project.

## mp_lists

Implemented algorithms for a linked list data structure in C++, including functions for rotation, reversal, sorting, and merging. Utilized pointer manipulation and recursive techniques to achieve efficient and correct behavior. Tested code extensively, including edge cases and potential issues with memory allocation and modification. Completed as part of an MP project for a course in data structures and algorithms.
